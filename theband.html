                        between 1966 and 1971, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed.
                        They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for
                        the American television series The Monkees which aired from 1966 to 1968. 
                        The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork;
                        and British actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially
                        supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of 
                        Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart. The four actor-musicians were allowed only limited 
                        roles in the recording studio for the first few months of their five-year career as
                        "the Monkees". This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the
                        television series.[1] Nonetheless,Nesmith did compose and produce some songs 
                        from the beginning, and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the
                        sessions produced by Nesmith. They eventually fought for the right to collectively
                        supervise all musical output under the band's name. The television show was
                        canceled in 1968, but the band continued to record music through 1971.
